      <h3 style="color:#1a325d; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:700;">Marketing – Use Your Dependability to Build Trust at Scale</h3>
      <p>
        You’re reliable and trusted by your clients, but now it’s time to show the world what you’re capable of. You don’t need to be flashy — you just need to share your value consistently so others can see it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Moves to execute:</strong> Client Success Stories: Your clients already trust you. Turn that trust into marketing. Create case studies, testimonials, and videos that highlight the success you’ve brought them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What to do:</em> Ask for testimonials after every successful project. Create videos or write blog posts where your clients share their success stories. Share these consistently on your website and social media.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
        You don’t need to be an expert in content creation. Just share your stories and how you help clients. Your audience connects with you because they trust you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What to do:</em> Start posting regularly about your work: client success, behind-the-scenes insights, and why you do what you do. Use simple language and make it relatable.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p><em>What To Do:</em> Schedule a 10-minute roleplay session every morning where your team practices the sales script and handles objections. Make sure they rotate roles so they understand both sides.</p>
      <p><strong>Automate Follow-Ups:</strong> You’re great at follow-ups, but you need to automate the process to stay on top of leads and prospects without doing everything yourself.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Use your CRM to set up automated follow-up emails, text reminders, and calendar invites. This keeps you consistent without extra manual effort.</p>

      <p><strong>Moves to execute:</strong> Authority Library - Every deal closed = 1 testimonial, 1 case study, and 1 short clip. Systematize it.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Immediately start collecting testimonials right after every sale. Send a form to clients asking for their feedback and use their answers as case studies.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Own a niche. Pick 1 market and go deep into it — don’t scatter your efforts.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Choose one market segment and create a clear message for it. Write a manifesto or a mini-guide explaining why you’re the best solution for this niche.</p>
      <p><strong>Weekly Proof Content:</strong> Post proof every week. Use short videos, written case studies, or client stories.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Record one 60-second video every week talking about your latest win or success story. Post it on social media and tag your clients (with permission).</p>

      <p><strong>Moves to execute:</strong> Scripted Discovery: Write 7–10 mandatory questions that uncover pain, money, and urgency.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Develop a scripted discovery process for your team to use on every call. This should include:
      What problems are you facing?
      What is the cost of this problem?
      How soon do you need a solution?
      What’s the budget for solving this problem?</p>
      <p><strong>Roleplay Machine:</strong> Set up daily role-playing sessions before your team calls clients. This ensures they’re warmed up, not testing on clients.</p>

      <p><strong>Pipeline Math:</strong> Track: calls made → contacts → appointments → closes. You need to know where your sales process breaks.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Use a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system to track every stage of your sales funnel. Measure how many calls result in appointments, and how many appointments close.</p>
      <p><strong>Objection Arsenal:</strong> Write the top 10 objections and your exact responses.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Have your team roleplay objections daily. Keep a shared document of the top objections and how to respond. Make sure the responses are detailed and not vague.</p>
      <p><strong>Shadow & Switch:</strong> Let your reps shadow you on calls, then switch — they shadow and you close.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Have 1 team member shadow your next 3 calls. After that, you shadow their next 3 calls, so they get feedback on their approach.</p>

      <p><strong>Leadership Bench:</strong> Identify 2 leaders you can trust to run without you.</p>
      <p><em>What to do:</em> Pick two team members to groom for leadership. Give them increased responsibility and set up 1:1s to review their progress. Start giving them decision-making power.</p>

      <p><em>What to do:</em> Set up weekly 1:1 meetings with your team where you track both their performance and personal growth. This builds trust and empowers them.</p>
      <p><strong>Reward Structure:</strong> Only reward measurable outcomes, not effort.</p>
